# hreflang-chcker
free crawl a domain to check hreflang tags are on the pages the way they should be


Packages to install:
	- urllib
	- bs4
	- requests
	- time

runs on python 3.x

does not check sitemap implementation -- may add that in the future

forgot to update the prompt, domain and start page should be comma seperated not new line... as per the example.

Also the compiled dist seems to be working so there is that.
